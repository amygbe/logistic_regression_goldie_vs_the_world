# logistic_regression_goldie_vs_the_world

This just a little logistic regression model made to determine whether a given photo is a random photo or a photo of my beautiful cat Goldie!

### Notes

In the images folder there are only 5 images each in the random photo folder and the goldie pics folder just as examples. I used 400 photos of each categroy to trian the model.
