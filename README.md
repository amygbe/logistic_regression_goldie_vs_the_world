# logistic_regression_goldie_vs_the_world

This just a little logistic regression model made to determine whether a given photo is a random photo or a photo of my beautiful cat Goldie!

- **goldie_vs_the_world.py** is the main project file. Uses functions from **proj_fcns.py**
- **priv_upsplash_rand_images.py** collects 400 random images using the upsplash API
  - The images of Goldie came from my phone
- **goldie vs the world.ipynb** is mostly the same as my main file, but for the purposes of creating a md file for my website

### Other Notes

In the images folder there are only 5 images each in the random photo folder and the goldie pics folder just as examples. I used 400 photos of each categroy to trian the model.
